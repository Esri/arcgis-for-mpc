# ArcGIS for Microsoft Planetary Computer

ArcGIS for Microsoft Planetary Computer is an offering from Esri that brings hundreds of ready-to-use analysis tools from ArcGIS to the [Microsoft Planetary Computer](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/) so you can observe and monitor the planet.
It provides direct access to the [Microsoft Planetary Computer Data Catalog](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog) within the ArcGIS Pro interface so you can immediately start analyzing petabytes worth of data.

The Microsoft Planetary Computer Data Catalog includes petabytes of environmental monitoring data, in consistent, analysis-ready formats. The catalog includes commonly used [imagery](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog#Imagery), [DEMs](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/catalog#DEMs) and a large number of derived and/or observed environmental data sets.
